- 👋 Hi, I’m @nostra9, and I'm a senior in high school.
- 👀 I’m interested in majoring in Computer Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java in an AP Computer Science course, I have been learning for about 1 to 1 and a half years
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my own projects atm, but I do little challenges on the side (those can also just be projects I am working on that are not labs for my class)
- 📫 How to reach me: I use discord frequently (thesmallman#2480)
